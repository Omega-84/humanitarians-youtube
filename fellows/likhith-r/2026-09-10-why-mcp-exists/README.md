# Why MCP Exists

**Fellow:** Likhith R. · **Week:** 2026-09-10 · **Builder:** `ai-explainer` on `claude-hai` · **Voice:** Kokoro `am_onyx` (AI narration)

A 60-second explainer on why the Model Context Protocol exists when APIs already let software talk to software: each tool becomes one MCP server that any agent can discover and call the same way, on top of the real API.

## This week's contribution
- **Question:** If APIs already connect software, why do AI agents need MCP?
- **Prediction:** I expected the difference between APIs and MCP to be easy to show in 60 seconds.
- **What I built/tried:** 12 beats covering seven points I set: the API hook; per-tool auth, formats and docs; one server per tool; runtime tool discovery; adding a tool without hardcoding; agents chaining tools; the checkout/terminal analogy. Tool discovery is shown from a real run of a toy MCP server (`evidence/mcp_discovery.py`). Seven custom dual-aspect scenes in `scenes/McpProtocol.tsx`.
- **Observed result:** Both cuts render at native 4K (63.9 s). GATE F, L, T (unmodified checker) and V (0 blocker / 0 major) pass on 16:9 and 9:16.
- **Next experiment:** Connect an agent to a real vendor's MCP server and compare the setup effort with a direct API integration.

## Human and AI work
**My decisions, implementation and verification:**
- Chose the topic and wrote the content brief (the points the beats cover), and set the 12-beat / ~60 s / Kokoro `am_onyx` / native 16:9 + 9:16 constraints.
- Set the branding: @HumanitariansAI channel, "Irreducibly Human" kicker, and the required opening line.
- Watched both cuts and signed off every claim in `FACTCHECK.md`.

**AI tools/voices used and what they generated:**
- Claude Code (Anthropic) drafted the beat sheet and narration, wrote the custom scenes in `scenes/`, ran the evidence code, checked claims against `SOURCES.md`, ran the Brutalist pipeline and gates, and fixed layout defects found in visual QC.
- Narration is an AI voice (Kokoro `am_onyx`, local). **It is not a recording of Likhith.**

**What I rejected or corrected:**
- MCP does not remove authentication: each server still authenticates to the API it wraps. The verdict card says so.
- "No custom code per tool" is true from the agent's side; someone still writes each server once. The "3 + 4 = 7, each built once" count makes that explicit.
- The payment-terminal analogy is mine and is labelled as an analogy; tool names and formats on screen are illustrative.
- Portrait layouts redesigned so every text cluster clears the 9:16 type floor; McpStandard's bar fill darkened for contrast.

**What remains unverified or failed:**
- The required intro "Hi, I am Likhith…" is spoken by the AI narrator; the AI narration is disclosed on screen (opening beat and outro).
- YouTube 4K processing check and the professors' publication decision are pending.

## Reproduce
- **Brutalist version/commit:** nikbearbrown/brutalist.art `6a8380a`.
- **Source commit used for this export:** not committed — `6a8380a` plus local changes: `scenes/McpProtocol.tsx`, `scenes/JevExplainer.tsx`, `scenes/HaiOutro.tsx` added under `runtime/remotion/src/`, each exported component registered in `Root.tsx` as `<Name>` (1920×1080) and `<Name>916` (1080×1920), and `durationSeconds` hooks added to `ClaudeComposerAsk916`, `BrutalistHesitantWriter916`, `ClaudeVerdictArtifact916`. `type_check.py` is the unmodified toolkit version.
- **Beat sheet and custom scene files:** `beat_sheet.json` (16:9), `vertical/beat_sheet.json` (9:16), `scenes/McpProtocol.tsx`, `scenes/JevExplainer.tsx`, `scenes/HaiOutro.tsx`.
- **Commands** (toolkit root, Python 3.12 venv, MacTeX on PATH; reel at `youtube/brutalist/claude-hai-mcp-protocol/`):
  ```bash
  python3 runtime/scripts/generate_audio_kokoro.py <reel>
  python3 runtime/scripts/remotion_scenes.py <reel>
  ./art run <reel>                                              # 16:9 review
  ./art vertical <reel>                                         # then restore vertical/beat_sheet.json from this folder
  python3 runtime/scripts/remotion_scenes.py <reel>/vertical
  ./art final <reel>                                            # 16:9 master (GATE T first)
  ./art final <reel>/vertical --height 3840                     # 9:16 master
  ```
  ```bash
  # executable evidence (see SOURCES.md for the exact environment)
  ls evidence/
  ```
