# Mixture of Experts

**Fellow:** Likhith R. · **Week:** 2026-09-18 · **Builder:** `ai-explainer` on `claude-hai` · **Voice:** Kokoro `am_onyx` (AI narration)

A 60-second explainer on Mixture of Experts: a router sends each token to a few small expert blocks, so a model can hold far more parameters than it runs per token, at the cost of keeping every expert in memory.

## This week's contribution
- **Question:** How do Mixture of Experts models stay fast with so many parameters?
- **Prediction:** I expected "experts" to be separate specialist sub-models inside one big model.
- **What I built/tried:** 12 beats covering the points I set: the parameter-count hook; dense models; experts inside each layer; the router picking two of eight; only chosen experts running; Mixtral's published 47B total vs ~13B active; the memory catch. Seven custom dual-aspect scenes in `scenes/MoeExplainer.tsx`.
- **Observed result:** Both cuts render at native 4K (62.7 s). GATE F, L, T (unmodified checker) and V (0/0) pass on 16:9 and 9:16.
- **Next experiment:** Look into how routers are trained to balance load across experts, as a possible follow-up video.

## Human and AI work
**My decisions, implementation and verification:**
- Chose the topic and wrote the content brief (the points the beats cover), and set the 12-beat / ~60 s / Kokoro `am_onyx` / native 16:9 + 9:16 constraints.
- Set the branding: @HumanitariansAI channel, "Irreducibly Human" kicker, and the required opening line.
- Watched both cuts and signed off every claim in `FACTCHECK.md`.

**AI tools/voices used and what they generated:**
- Claude Code (Anthropic) drafted the beat sheet and narration, wrote the custom scenes in `scenes/`, ran the evidence code, checked claims against `SOURCES.md`, ran the Brutalist pipeline and gates, and fixed layout defects found in visual QC.
- Narration is an AI voice (Kokoro `am_onyx`, local). **It is not a recording of Likhith.**

**What I rejected or corrected:**
- "Experts" are the feed-forward blocks inside each layer, not separate topic-specialist models; the video never claims an expert "knows" a subject.
- Active parameters aren't simply 2/8 of the model, because shared weights always run; the video uses Mixtral's published ~13B instead of a derived ratio.
- "Double the size, double the cost" is shown qualitatively; router scores and token words are illustrative.
- Bar fills darkened for contrast; the verdict gained a sixth, fact-checked line (DeepSeek-V3) so the portrait card fills properly.

**What remains unverified or failed:**
- The required intro "Hi, I am Likhith…" is spoken by the AI narrator; the AI narration is disclosed on screen (opening beat and outro).
- YouTube 4K processing check and the professors' publication decision are pending.

## Reproduce
- **Brutalist version/commit:** nikbearbrown/brutalist.art `6a8380a`.
- **Source commit used for this export:** not committed — `6a8380a` plus local changes: `scenes/MoeExplainer.tsx`, `scenes/JevExplainer.tsx`, `scenes/HaiOutro.tsx` added under `runtime/remotion/src/`, each exported component registered in `Root.tsx` as `<Name>` (1920×1080) and `<Name>916` (1080×1920), and `durationSeconds` hooks added to `ClaudeComposerAsk916`, `BrutalistHesitantWriter916`, `ClaudeVerdictArtifact916`. `type_check.py` is the unmodified toolkit version.
- **Beat sheet and custom scene files:** `beat_sheet.json` (16:9), `vertical/beat_sheet.json` (9:16), `scenes/MoeExplainer.tsx`, `scenes/JevExplainer.tsx`, `scenes/HaiOutro.tsx`.
- **Commands** (toolkit root, Python 3.12 venv, MacTeX on PATH; reel at `youtube/brutalist/claude-hai-mixture-of-experts/`):
  ```bash
  python3 runtime/scripts/generate_audio_kokoro.py <reel>
  python3 runtime/scripts/remotion_scenes.py <reel>
  ./art run <reel>                                              # 16:9 review
  ./art vertical <reel>                                         # then restore vertical/beat_sheet.json from this folder
  python3 runtime/scripts/remotion_scenes.py <reel>/vertical
  ./art final <reel>                                            # 16:9 master (GATE T first)
  ./art final <reel>/vertical --height 3840                     # 9:16 master
  ```
