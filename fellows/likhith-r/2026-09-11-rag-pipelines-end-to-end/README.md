# RAG Pipelines, End to End

**Fellow:** Likhith R. · **Week:** 2026-09-11 · **Builder:** `ai-explainer` on `claude-hai` · **Voice:** Kokoro `am_onyx` (AI narration)

A 60-second explainer on retrieval-augmented generation: instead of retraining a model on your documents, embed and store them as vectors, retrieve the closest chunks for each question, and ground the answer in them.

## This week's contribution
- **Question:** How can an LLM answer questions about documents it was never trained on?
- **Prediction:** I expected the five-step pipeline to map neatly onto the beats, with retrieval as the easy part.
- **What I built/tried:** 12 beats covering eight points I set, as five steps: embed, store, retrieve, augment, generate. The cosine-similarity formula is typeset properly and the similarity scores on screen come from a real script (`evidence/cosine_toy.py`). Seven custom dual-aspect scenes in `scenes/RagPipeline.tsx`.
- **Observed result:** Both cuts render at native 4K (65.9 s). GATE F, L, T (unmodified checker) and V (0/0) pass on 16:9 and 9:16.
- **Next experiment:** Build a small RAG pipeline over a real document set and measure how often retrieval misses the right chunk.

## Human and AI work
**My decisions, implementation and verification:**
- Chose the topic and wrote the content brief (the points the beats cover), and set the 12-beat / ~60 s / Kokoro `am_onyx` / native 16:9 + 9:16 constraints.
- Set the branding: @HumanitariansAI channel, "Irreducibly Human" kicker, and the required opening line.
- Watched both cuts and signed off every claim in `FACTCHECK.md`.

**AI tools/voices used and what they generated:**
- Claude Code (Anthropic) drafted the beat sheet and narration, wrote the custom scenes in `scenes/`, ran the evidence code, checked claims against `SOURCES.md`, ran the Brutalist pipeline and gates, and fixed layout defects found in visual QC.
- Narration is an AI voice (Kokoro `am_onyx`, local). **It is not a recording of Likhith.**

**What I rejected or corrected:**
- "Answer accurately" softened: RAG improves grounding, it doesn't guarantee accuracy. The verdict adds that it is only as good as its retrieval.
- Cosine similarity is named as the common metric, not the only one; the 2-D vectors are labelled as toys (real embeddings have hundreds of dimensions).
- Retraining cost kept qualitative, with no invented figures; documents, chunks and answers on screen are illustrative.
- Portrait layouts redesigned for the 9:16 type floor; greeting changed to "Hey, Likhith".

**What remains unverified or failed:**
- The required intro "Hi, I am Likhith…" is spoken by the AI narrator; the AI narration is disclosed on screen (opening beat and outro).
- YouTube 4K processing check and the professors' publication decision are pending.

## Reproduce
- **Brutalist version/commit:** nikbearbrown/brutalist.art `6a8380a`.
- **Source commit used for this export:** not committed — `6a8380a` plus local changes: `scenes/RagPipeline.tsx`, `scenes/JevExplainer.tsx`, `scenes/HaiOutro.tsx` added under `runtime/remotion/src/`, each exported component registered in `Root.tsx` as `<Name>` (1920×1080) and `<Name>916` (1080×1920), and `durationSeconds` hooks added to `ClaudeComposerAsk916`, `BrutalistHesitantWriter916`, `ClaudeVerdictArtifact916`. `type_check.py` is the unmodified toolkit version.
- **Beat sheet and custom scene files:** `beat_sheet.json` (16:9), `vertical/beat_sheet.json` (9:16), `scenes/RagPipeline.tsx`, `scenes/JevExplainer.tsx`, `scenes/HaiOutro.tsx`.
- **Commands** (toolkit root, Python 3.12 venv, MacTeX on PATH; reel at `youtube/brutalist/claude-hai-rag-pipelines/`):
  ```bash
  python3 runtime/scripts/generate_audio_kokoro.py <reel>
  python3 runtime/scripts/remotion_scenes.py <reel>
  ./art run <reel>                                              # 16:9 review
  ./art vertical <reel>                                         # then restore vertical/beat_sheet.json from this folder
  python3 runtime/scripts/remotion_scenes.py <reel>/vertical
  ./art final <reel>                                            # 16:9 master (GATE T first)
  ./art final <reel>/vertical --height 3840                     # 9:16 master
  ```
  ```bash
  # executable evidence (see SOURCES.md for the exact environment)
  ls evidence/
  ```
