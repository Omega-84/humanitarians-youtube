# Spec-Driven Development

**Fellow:** Likhith R. · **Week:** 2026-09-26 · **Builder:** `ai-explainer` on `claude-hai` · **Voice:** Kokoro `am_onyx` (AI narration)

A 60-second explainer on why spec-driven development makes AI-assisted coding maintainable: write the spec first, treat it (not the prompt history) as the source of truth, and use it to cut guesswork, review changes, keep context, and catch scope drift.

## This week's contribution
- **Question:** Why does spec-driven development make AI-assisted coding maintainable?
- **Prediction:** I expected this one to go faster than the Jev video by reusing its scenes, and an argument-style topic to need little sourcing.
- **What I built/tried:** 12 beats covering seven points I set: the vibe-coding hook; the definition; less guesswork; reviewability; living documentation; visible scope drift; maintainable at scale — one login-feature example throughout. Rendered natively in 16:9 and 9:16, with seven custom dual-aspect scenes in `scenes/SpecDriven.tsx` (which imports shared helpers and the outro from `scenes/JevExplainer.tsx`).
- **Observed result:** Both cuts render at native 4K (61.8 s). 16:9 passes GATE F, L and V (0/0); every 9:16 scene passes GATE V on its own frames.
- **Next experiment:** Try spec-driven development with GitHub Spec Kit on a small real feature and note where the spec caught or missed problems.

## Human and AI work
**My decisions, implementation and verification:**
- Chose the topic and wrote the content brief (the points the beats cover), and set the 12-beat / ~60 s / Kokoro `am_onyx` / native 16:9 + 9:16 constraints.
- Set the branding: on-screen greeting "Namaskaram, Likhith", the @HumanitariansAI channel, and the required opening line.
- Watched both the 16:9 and 9:16 cuts, checked each claim in `FACTCHECK.md` against the sources, and approved the final masters.

**AI tools/voices used and what they generated:**
- Claude Code (Anthropic) drafted the beat sheet and narration, wrote the custom scenes in `scenes/`, checked claims against `SOURCES.md`, ran the Brutalist pipeline and gates, and fixed layout defects found in visual QC.
- Narration is an AI voice (Kokoro `am_onyx`, local). **It is not a recording of Likhith.**

**What I rejected or corrected:**
- Argument video: no productivity or defect numbers claimed; the B08 curve is labelled "qualitative sketch, not data".
- Example files, code and diff sizes are labelled illustrative on screen.
- 16:9 tag wrapping (B06) and five portrait layout defects (B01, B03, B06, B08, B11) fixed after visual QC.

**What remains unverified or failed:**
- The required intro "Hi, I am Likhith…" is spoken by the AI narrator; the AI narration is disclosed on screen (opening beat and outro).
- YouTube 4K processing check and the professors' publication decision are pending.

## Reproduce
- **Brutalist version/commit and date checked:** nikbearbrown/brutalist.art `6a8380a` (2026-09-20), checked 2026-09-26.
- **Source commit used for this export:** not committed — `6a8380a` plus local changes: `scenes/SpecDriven.tsx`, `scenes/JevExplainer.tsx`, `scenes/HaiOutro.tsx` added under `runtime/remotion/src/`, each exported component registered in `Root.tsx` as `<Name>` (1920×1080) and `<Name>916` (1080×1920), and `durationSeconds` hooks added to `ClaudeComposerAsk916`, `BrutalistHesitantWriter916`, `ClaudeVerdictArtifact916`.
- **Beat sheet and custom scene files:** `beat_sheet.json` (16:9), `vertical/beat_sheet.json` (9:16), `scenes/SpecDriven.tsx`, `scenes/JevExplainer.tsx`, `scenes/HaiOutro.tsx`.
- **Commands** (toolkit root, Python 3.12 venv, MacTeX on PATH; reel at `youtube/brutalist/claude-hai-spec-driven-development/`):
  ```bash
  python3 runtime/scripts/generate_audio_kokoro.py <reel>
  python3 runtime/scripts/remotion_scenes.py <reel>
  ./art run <reel>                                              # 16:9
  ./art vertical <reel>                                         # then restore vertical/beat_sheet.json from this folder
  python3 runtime/scripts/remotion_scenes.py <reel>/vertical
  python3 runtime/scripts/compile.py <reel>/vertical --review --height 3840
  ./art final <reel>                                            # 16:9 master (GATE T first)
  ./art final <reel>/vertical --height 3840                     # 9:16 master
  ```
